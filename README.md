# DeepLearningLabs

1. [Lab1](Lab1.ipynb): PyTorch fundamentals.

2. [Lab1_MLP](Lab1_MLP.ipynb): PyTorch implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron.

3. [Lab1_MyMLP](Lab1_MyMLP.ipynb): Some changes on the code wrt Lab1_MLP implementation.

4. [Lab2](Lab2.ipynb): Re-running the MLP implemented in Lab1_MLP, comparing perfromances in centered vs. translated images.

Some .ipynb files contains LaTEX formatting errors (because of the lack of some packages). You should be able to solve this by opening them through Google Colab.
